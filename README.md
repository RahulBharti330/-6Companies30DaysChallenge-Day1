#  Overview

Welcome to the "6 Companies 30 Days Challenge" repository, an intensive initiative designed by Arsh Goyal. The challenge focuses on honing your Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) skills through a curated set of problems. It is a month-long coding journey to solve 90 most frequent and important questions asked by some of the top tech companies, helping to improve skills and prepare for interviews.

#  Purpose of this Repository

The repository is organized into daily folders, each containing solutions to DSA questions. The questions are carefully selected to cover various topics, including arrays, linked lists, trees, sorting algorithms, and more.

Feel free to navigate through the folders and explore my solutions. The code is written in [Programming Language], and each solution includes a brief explanation of the approach and any key insights.

#  Usage

Feel free to use this repository as a reference for your own DSA journey or as a starting point for discussions. If you notice any improvements or have suggestions for better solutions, I'd love to hear from you.
